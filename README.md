# Trillo Demo

Mock travel website.

## Description

The Trillo project is a mock travel website designed to display user reviews, hotel features, user nav, etc.
This was created following a tutorial on Udemy.

## Primary Focus

This project heavily relied on flexbox. The goal was to increase my comfort level with flexbox and gainer a deeper knowledge of how it can be used to build a responsive website.
